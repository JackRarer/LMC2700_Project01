										<h2>LMC2700 and the Promise of CM</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Coming to Georgia Tech last year, I was an LMC freshman hoping to get into filmmaking and screenwriting, but my passion for both slipped away over the year. I'm not too sad about it. Just wasn't my thing anymore. But design was. I loved working on my highschool's literary magazine, Georgia Tech's Erato publication, and most recently a magazine for my media internship last summer. I love the process of storytelling through design and the creative liberties and challenges that work in design pose. Truthfully however, I'm a novice. I have the passion, but not the prowess. Hopefully, this course will fix that, or at least put me on the right track. </p>

												<h3>Technical Ability</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I hope to be a UI artist in the future, but I haven't mastered the tools of the trade. My HTML skills are limited, I haven't worked with much design software, and the vast amount of resources and programs I should familiarize myself with is overwhelming. I don't need to come out of this a profesional, but a little more confidence would go a long way.</p>

												<h3>Purposeful Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My internship taught me lots, but knowing what information is important, where information should be presented, and how to understand both according to different audiences is incredibly important and interesting to me. I don't expect too much emphasis on this in this class, but I hope to encorperate this thought process into each of my projects.</p>

												<h3>Finding My Style</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My portfolio of work is incredibly limited, and most of it piggybacks off of established work, this webpage included. I hope to develop my own style, and I hope this course challenges me to do so. In a world where AI can generate nearly anything that artists used to, differentiating my work feels more important than ever.</p>

										<h2>The Point</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As of now, this portfolio is empty. I considered filling it in with an assortment of my prior work, but I'm not incrediby proud of any of it nor is any of it consistent. Instead, I'm making this a "before and after" for myself, a display of the work I'll make this semester. I hope when I come back to this in December, I'll look back at these goals knowing I worked towards them with as much excitement as I imagined I'd have when I wrote them. Maybe even more. </p>
