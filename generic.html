									<p>Hi, I'm Jack. I'm a second year CM major hoping to hoodwink enough employers to get myself a career as a UI artist, and if you've made it this far, I'm sure you're hoping I have a back up plan. I do not.</p>
									<p>I've only ever really considered myself an artist in retrospect. In highschool, I was the editor in chief of my school's literary magazine, and designing, formatting, and toying with the publication was one of if not the most rewarding experiences of those short years. It didn't feel like much at the time - just a hobby of sorts. It wasn't until I graduated that designing things like that was something real people with real jobs did to make real money. In fact, my first ever "real job" was doing just that, designing and publishing a magazine for a real company. Crazy. </p>
									<p>I'm not sure exaclty what I want to do with a UI career, or even if I want to stick with that. Creating my own literary magazine or publication and making enough money off of that to not be homeless sounds like a dream, but I have a few more years to figure that out. Until then, I figure I'll just do enough future-proofing that my parents don't worry about me, and I think that should cover it.</p>
